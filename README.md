# Wallet Integration Implementation

## Project Overview

This document details the implementation of MetaMask and TronLink wallet integrations into the Next.js dashboard starter project. The integration allows users to connect their cryptocurrency wallets directly from the application interface.
## Implementation Details

### 1. State Management with Zustand

I implemented a custom Zustand store to manage wallet connections and state:

- Created `wallet-store.ts` to handle wallet connection logic and state management
- Implemented methods for connecting to MetaMask and TronLink
- Added functionality to detect already connected wallets on startup
- Implemented disconnection functionality
- Added event listeners for account and chain changes

### 2. Context Provider for Application-Wide Access

To make wallet functionality available throughout the application:

- Created a `WalletContextProvider` that wraps the application layout
- Built a custom `useWallet` hook for easy access to wallet functions from any component
- Added connection attempt tracking to handle UI states appropriately

### 3. UI Integration

For a seamless user experience, I implemented:

- A status bar that displays between the header and main content
- Alert-style notifications that show connection status
- Clean, minimal wallet connection buttons styled to match the application theme
- Address truncation for better readability

### 4. TypeScript Implementation

Ensured type safety throughout the implementation:

- Added proper TypeScript interfaces for all components
- Implemented global type declarations for wallet objects
- Created explicit type definitions for context values

## Technical Implementation

### Key Files Created/Modified:

1. **State Management:**
   - `stores/wallet-store.ts` - Zustand store for wallet state management

2. **Context Management:**
   - `features/wallet/wallet-context.tsx` - Context provider implementation
   - `components/wallet/wallet-status-bar.tsx` - UI component for wallet status

3. **Layout Integration:**
   - Modified `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` to include the wallet context provider

### Cross-Browser & Cross-OS Compatibility

Implemented with compatibility as a priority:

- Used standard Web3 APIs supported across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- Implemented proper error handling for different wallet states
- Added fallbacks for when wallets are not installed
